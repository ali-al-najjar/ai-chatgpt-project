# ai-chatGPT-project
This Web site provides information about artificial intelligence and ChatGPT.
We've worked on this project as a team, and through this project, we've learned more about parallax and how to implement this feature using CSS.
we're providing three different ways of using Parallax effect:

* Use a background and make two floating boxes on top of it (Homepage)
* Use a background and make a whole content section to scroll above it (ChatGPT page)
* Use a background and many other layers to give it a 3D feeling (Artificial Intelligence page)

### languages which we use in the project
